We had a project where we wanted to move off of Omnissa DEM Folder Redirection and onto Folder Redirection via GPO. The 2 scripts worked to get users into the appropriate groups and remove them from the older DEM conditional groups, then copy their data from the old server to the new ensuring to preserve timestamps, etc. Scripts should be run on the share server hosting the original user's data as you're then able to grab the IPs of the machines the user is logged into to reboot them to grab the new FolderRedirection GPO policy on their next login.
