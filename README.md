We had a project where we wanted to move off of Omnissa DEM Folder Redirection and onto Folder Redirection via GPO. The 2 scripts worked to get users into and out of the appropriate groups, then copy their data from the old server to the new ensuring to preserve timestamps, etc. Scripts should be run on the share server hosting the original user's data as you're then able to grab the IPs of the machines the user is logged into to send reboot commands to ensure they grab the new FolderRedirection GPO policy on their next login.

The $legacyGroups variable can be commented out if you don't use conditions for DEM policies, but you may want to add a conditional "-NOT in FolderRedirectionUsers" so that the DEM policies do not try to apply to already migrated users in the FolderRedirectionUsers group. If you comment out $legacyGroups, be sure to also comment out the foreach loops under the "# Check legacy DEM groups" sections.
